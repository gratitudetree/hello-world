hello-world
===========

To create a new branch

Go to your new repository hello-world.
Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.


Now you have two branches, master and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.


Make a commit
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Commits are pretty glorious, because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.

Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Thanks to these messages, you and others can read through commits and understand what you’ve done and why.

You should still be on the code view for your readme-edits branch, now make some changes!

To commit changes

Click the README file.
Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write some text, tell a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.

Click Commit changes. Now these changes have been made to the README file on your readme-edits branch and now this branch contains different content and commits than master (as it should!).
